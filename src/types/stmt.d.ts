/**
 * @classdesc  A class encapsulating a prepared query statement. It includes
 * state that can be sent to a server and executed without re-parsing the
 * query. It includes bind variables which may be set for each successive use
 * of the query.  PreparedStatement object is returned as a result of
 * {@link NoSQLClient#prepare} method.  It can be passed to
 * {@link NoSQLClient#query} and {@link NoSQLClient#queryIterable} methods for
 * execution and be reused for multiple queries, potentially with different
 * values of bind variables.
 * <p>
 * You may share an instance of {@link PreparedStatement} by queries running
 * async-concurrently, e.g. queries invoked concurrently by different async
 * functions.  This is referred to as async-safety:
 * <br>
 * An instance of {@link PreparedStatement} is async-safe if bind variables
 * are not used.  If bind variables are used, it is not async-safe.  In this
 * case, you can construct additional instances of {@link PreparedStatement}
 * using {@link PreparedStatement#copyStatement} method in order to share it
 * among async-concurrent queries.
 * @extends {PrepareResult}

     * Binds a variable to use for the query.  The variable can be identified
     * either by its name or its position.
     * <p>
     * To bind by name, pass a name of the variable as it was declared in
     * <em>DECLARE</em> statement of the query.
     * <p>
     * You can also bind a variable by its position within the query string.
     * The positions start at 1. The variable that appears first in the query
     * text has position 1, the variable that appears second has position 2
     * and so on.  Binding by position is useful for queries where bind
     * variables identified by "?" are used instead of named variables (but it
     * can be used for both types of variables).
     * <p>
     * Existing variables with the same name or position are silently
     * overwritten. The names, positions and types are validated when the
     * query is executed.
     * 
     * @example
     * Binding variables by name.
     * ```ts
     * let client = new NoSQLClient(//.....
     * let prepStmt = await client.prepare(
     *     'DECLARE $id INTEGER; $sal DOUBLE;  SELECT id, firstName, lastName ' +

     * for await(const res of client.queryIterable(stmt)) {
     *     //.....
     * }
     * ps.set('$id', 2000);
     * for await(const res of client.queryIterable(stmt)) {
     *     //.....
     * }
     * //.....
     * ```
     * @example
     * Binding variables by position.
     * ```ts
     * let prepStmt = await client.prepare(
     *     'SELECT id, firstName, lastName FROM Emp WHERE ' + 
     *     'id <= ? AND salary <= ?');
     * ps.set(1, 1100)
     *   .set(2, 100500);
     * //.....
     * ```
     * @param {string|number} nameOrPosition Name or position of the variable
