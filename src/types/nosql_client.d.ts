/**
 * Defines NoSQLClient, which is the point of access to the
 * Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud service.
 */

/**
 * NoSQLClient class provides access to Oracle NoSQL Database
 * tables.  Methods of this class are used to create and manage tables and
 * indexes, and to read and write data. All operations are performed
 * asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * Each method returns a Promise object that will resolve to the
 * result of the operation if successful, or reject with an error upon
 * failure. To handle results and errors, you may use promise chains
 * with .then.catch or async functions with await.  The result of
 * operation is a JavaScript object with properties specific to each
 * operation and is documented for each method below.  If any error
 * has occurred, the promise will reject with {@link NoSQLError} or
 * one of its subclasses.
 * <p>
 * You instantiate NoSQLClient by providing connection and credential
 * information, either in the form of a configuration object of type
 * {@link Config} or a path to a file that holds {@link Config} information.
 * Some parameters, such as the service endpoint or region, are required.
 * Other parameters are optional and need not be specified in the
 * {@link Config}. Default values are used for optional parameters.
 * <p>
 * Note that it is possible to create {@link NoSQLClient} instance without
 * providing configuration if all of the following are true:
 * <ul>
 * <li>You are using {@link NoSQLClient} with the Cloud Service.</li>
 * <li>You store your credentials and region identifier in an OCI configuration
 * file with the default file path and default profile name.  See
 * {@link IAMConfig} for more information.</li>
 * <li>You use defaults for all other configuration properties.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Each method of NoSQLClient also takes an optional <em>opt</em>
 * parameter which contains options specific to a particular
 * operation.  Some of these options may be the same as those
 * specified by {@link Config} and will override the {@link Config}
 * values for this operation.  The method description describes which
 * options are pertinent for that operation. If an options is not
 * specified in the <em>opt</em> parameter and is also not present in
 * {@link Config}, the driver will use default values.
 * <p>
 * In general, same methods and options are applicable to both Oracle
 * NoSQL Database Cloud Service and On-Premise Oracle NoSQL Database.
 * However, some methods, options and result types may be specific to
 * particular {@link ServiceType}, which is specified in their documentation.
 * <p>
 * <em>For cloud service only:</em> for each method you may provide
 * <em>opt.compartment</em> which specifies the compartment of the given table
 * (or compartment used to perform given operation).  If not set in options or
 * initial config (see {@link Config#compartment}), the root
 * compartment of the tenancy is assumed. The compartment is a string that
 * may be either the id (OCID) of the compartment or a compartment name. Both
 * are acceptable. If a name is used it can be either the name of a top-level
 * compartment, or for nested compartments, it should be a compartment path
 * to the nested compartment that does not include the root compartment name
 * (tenant), e.g. <em>compartmentA.compartmentB.compartmentC</em>
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, instead of setting <em>opt.compartment</em>
 * you may prefix the table name with its compartment name (for top-level
 * compartments) or compartment path (for nested compartments), e.g.
 * <em>compartmentA.compartmentB.compartmentC:myTable</em>.
 * Note that the table name cannot be
 * prefixed with compartment id.  Prefixing the table with compartment
 * name/path takes precendence over other methods of specifying the
 * compartment.
 * <p>
 * For events emitted by {@link NoSQLClient}, see {@link NoSQLClientEvents}.
 *
 * @see {@page connect-cloud.md}
 * @see {@page connect-on-prem.md}
 * @see {@page tables.md}
 *
 * @example
 * Using {@link NoSQLClient} with async-await.
 * ```ts
 * const NoSQLClient = require('oracle-nosqldb').NoSQLClient;
 *
 * async function test() {
 *      let client;
 *      try {
 *          client = new NoSQLClient('config.json');
 *          let res = await client.tableDDL(
 *              'CREATE TABLE foo(id INTEGER, name STRING, PRIMARY KEY(id))',
 *              {
 *                  tableLimits: {
 *                      readUnits: 100,
 *                      writeUnits: 100,
 *                      storageGB: 50
 *                  }
 *              }
 *          );
 *          console.log('Table: %s, state: %s', res.tableName,
 *              res.tableState);
 *          await client.forCompletion(res);
 *          res = await client.put('foo', { id: 1, name: 'test' });
 *          res = await client.get('foo', { id: 1 });
 *          console.log(res.row);
 *          //..........
 *      } catch(err) {
 *          //handle errors
 *      } finally {
 *          if (client) {

     * some time.  In some instances, obtaining this information make take
     * some time, especially in cases when a network request to authorization
     * server is required, e.g. when using Cloud Service with Instance

     * obtain and pre-cache authorization information, so that when database
     * operations are issued, they do not need to spend any extra time on
     * obtaining authorization.
     * <p> A current use case for this method is when using Cloud Service
     * with Instance Principal, because a network request is required to
     * obtain authorization token (as well additional requests to obtain
     * instance region, instance certificates, instance private key, etc).
     * An alternative solution is to increase operation timeouts to allot
     * enough time to obtain authorzation token when required.  However,
     * calling {@link NoSQLClient#precacheAuth} will provide better
     * performance when starting multiple concurrent database operations.
     * <p>
     * Call this method after creating {@link NoSQLClient} instance before
     * performing database operations.  Note that after the authorization
     * expires, it will need to be obtained again which make take some time in
     * some cases as described above.  However, build-in authoirzation
     * providers used with this SDK are configured to refresh the
     * authorization in background ahead of its expiration so that database
     * operations may use existing authorization while the new one is obtained
     * in the background.
     * <p>
     * Calling this method is equivalient to calling {@link getAuthorization}
     * which will pre-cache the authorzation in the process, so if using
     * custom {@link AuthorizationProvider} that does not cache authorzation,
     * this method will have no effect.
     * <p>
     * This method does not take explicit timeout, but uses timeouts specified
     * for authorization network requests for given built-in authorization
     * provider.  See properties {@link IAMConfig#timeout} and
     * {@link KVStoreAuthConfig#timeout}.
     * @example
     * Using precacheAuth on new NoSQLClient instance.
     * ```ts
     * let client;
     * try {
     *     client = await new NoSQLClient(config).precacheAuth();

     * may be explicitly limited by setting {@link QueryOpt#limit}. For this
     * reason queries should always operate in a loop, acquiring more results,

    /**
     * This API facilitates iteration over query results returned by
     * {@link NoSQLClient#query} by using <em>for-await-of</em> loop.  The
     * iteration over query results is necessary because of the limitations
     * on the amount of data read during each query request as described in
     * {@link NoSQLClient#query}.  The iteration is asynchronous and each

     * this API is internally equivalent to calling {@link NoSQLClient#query}
     * in a loop and using continuation key returned in {@link QueryResult} to
     * continue the query.  Thus you do not need to explicitly manage
     * continuation key when using this API.
     * <p>
     * Note that calling this API by itself does not start
     * the query, the query is started when starting the iteration via
     * <em>for-await-of</em> loop.
     * <p>
     * The returned iterable cannot be reused for multiple queries.
     * To execute another query, call {@link NoSQLClient#queryIterable} again
     * to create a new iterable.
     * <p>
     * All other considerations described in {@link NoSQLClient#query} apply
     * when using this API.
     * @example
     * Using {@link queryIterable}.
     * ```ts
     * try {
     *     const stmt = 'SELECT * from orders';
     *     for await(const res of client.queryIterable(stmt)) {
     *         console.log(`Retrieved ${res.rows.length} rows`);
