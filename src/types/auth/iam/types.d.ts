/**
 * {@link IAMConfig} is required to authorize operations using Oracle Cloud
 * Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM).  It should be set as
 * {@link AuthConfig#iam}.
 * <p>
 * See {@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm | Overview of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management}
 * for information on IAM components and how they work together to provide
 * security for Oracle Cloud services.
 * <p>
 * All operations require a request signature that is used by the system to
 * authorize the operation.  The request signature may be created in one of
 * the following ways:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Using specific user's indentity.  See information below on what
 * credentials are required and how to obtain them, as well as the ways these
 * credentials may be provided to the driver via {@link IAMConfig}.</li>
 * <li>Using Instance Principal.  You may use Instance Principal when
 * calling Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service from a compute instance in the
 * Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). See
 * {@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm | Calling Services from an Instance}
 * for more information.  Use Instance Principal by setting
 * {@link IAMConfig#useInstancePrincipal} property to true.</li>
 * <li>Using Resource Principal.  You may use Resource Principal when calling
 * Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service from other Oracle Cloud service
 * resource such as
 * {@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Concepts/functionsoverview.htm | Functions}.
 * See
 * {@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Tasks/functionsaccessingociresources.htm | Accessing Other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Resources from Running Functions}
 * for more information.  Use Resouce Principal by setting
 * {@link IAMConfig#useResourcePrincipal} property to true.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Note that when using Instance Principal or Resource Principal you must
 * specify compartiment id (OCID), either as
 * {@link Config#compartment} property of the initial configuration or as
 * <em>opt.compartment</em> for each {@link NoSQLClient} method call.  Note
 * that you must use compartment id (OCID) and not compartment name.  This
 * also means that you may not prefix table name with compartment name when
 * calling methods of {@link NoSQLClient}.  These restrictions do not apply
 * when using specific user identity, which is best when naming flexibility is
 * desired.
 * <p>
 * To use specific user's identity, you must provide the following credentials:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Tenancy OCID.  This is Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) for your tenancy.  See
 * {@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm | Resource Identifiers}
 * for information on OCIDs.</li>
 * <li>User's OCID.  This is Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) for the user in your
 * tenancy.  See
 * {@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm | Resource Identifiers}
 * for information on OCIDs.</li>
 * <li>API Signing Key.  This is public-private key pair used to sign the API
 * requests, see {@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm | Required Keys and OCIDs}.
 * In particular, private key is needed to generate the request signature.</li>
 * <li>Public Key Fingerprint.  This is an identifier of the public key of the
 * API Signing Key pair.</li>
 * <li>Passphrase for the private key of API Signing Key pair if the private
 * key is encrypted.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * See {@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm | Required Keys and OCIDs}
 * for detailed description of the above credentials and the steps you need to
 * perform to enable signing of API requests, which are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Generate the key pair described above.</li>
 * <li>Upload public key.</li>
 * <li>Obtain tenancy and user OCIDs and public key fingerprint.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * You may provide these credentials in one of the following ways, in order of
 * increased security:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Directly as properties of {@link IAMConfig}.
 * In this case, set properties {@link tenantId}, {@link userId},
 * {@link privateKey} or {@link privateKeyFile}, {@link fingerprint} and
 * {@link passphrase} (if private key is encrypted)</li>
 * <li>As part of an OCI configuration file.  See
 * {@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm | SDK and CLI Configuration File}
 * for information on OCI configuration file and what entries are used for the
 * required credentials.  In this case, you may set properties
 * {@link configFile} and/or {@link profileName}.  If not set,
 * appropriate default values will be used, see property descriptions.</li>
 * <li>Specify your own credentials provider in the form of
 * {@link IAMCredentialsProvider} that implements {@link loadIAMCredentials}
 * function.  This allows you to store and retrieve credentials in a secure
 * manner.  In this case, specify {@link credentialsProvider} property.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Note that the private key must be in PEM format.  You may provide a path
 * to the PEM key file.  Alternatively, except when using OCI configuration
 * file, you may provide PEM encoded private key directly as <em>Buffer</em>
 * or <em>string</em>.  Note that the {@link passphrase} must be provided if
 * the private key is encrypted.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The driver will determine the method of authorization as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>If {@link IAMConfig#useResourcePrincipal} is set to <em>true</em>, then
 * Resource Principal authentication will be used.  No other properties listed
 * below are allowed for Resource Prinicpal authorization.</li>
 * <li>If {@link IAMConfig#useInstancePrincipal} is set to <em>true</em>, then
 * Instance Principal authentication will be used.  You may also set
 * {@link IAMConfig#federationEndpoint}, although it is not requred and in
 * most cases federation endpoint will be auto-detected.  No other properties
 * listed below are allowed for Instance Principal authorization.</li>
 * <li>If {@link useSessionToken} is set to <em>true</em>, then session
 * token-based authentication will be used. Note that this method uses OCI
 * config file, so settings to properties {@link configFile} and
 * {@link profileName} also apply. See {@link useSessionToken} for more
 * information.
 * <li>If {@link IAMConfig} has any of user identity properties such as
 * {@link tenantId}, {@link userId}, {@link privateKey}, {@link fingerprint}
 * or {@link passphrase}, the driver assumes that you are using a specific
 * user's identity and that the credentials are provided directly in
 * {@link IAMConfig}.  All required user's credentials, as described above,
 * must be present as properties of {@link IAMConfig}, otherwise
 * {@link NoSQLArgumentError} will result.</li>
 * <li>If {@link IAMConfig} has {@link credentialsProvider} property, the
 * driver assumes that you are using a specific user's identity and the
 * credentials are obtained through the credentials provider which must be in
 * the form of {@link IAMCredentialsProvider}.  In this case the credentials
 * must not be set directly in {@link IAMConfig}.</li>
 * <li>If none of the above, the driver assumes that you are using a specific
 * user's identity and the credentials are stored in OCI config
 * file and will use {@link configFile} and {@link profileName} properties
 * if present, otherwise it will assume their default values.  In particular,
 * if you specify {@link Config#serviceType} as {@link ServiceType.CLOUD}
 * and omit {@link Config#auth} alltogether, the driver will use IAM
 * authorization with default OCI config file and default profile name.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Note that if using an OCI configuration file, you may also specify region
 * identifier in the same profile as your credentials.  In this case, you need
 * not specify either region or endpoint in {@link Config}.  In particular,
 * if you use the default OCI config file (<em>~/.oci/config</em>) and default
 * profile name (<em>DEFAULT</em>) and do not need to customize any other
 * configuration properties, you may create {@link NoSQLClient} instance
 * without providing configuration to {@link NoSQLClient} constructor.
 * See {@link NoSQLClient} for more information.
 * <p>
 * If using Resource Principal, you also need not specify either region or
 * endpoint in {@link Config}, as Resource Principal's region will be used.
 * In fact, when running in Functions service, you may only access NoSQL
 * service in the same region as the running function, so when using Resource
 * Principal, it is preferable not to specify either region or endpoint in
 * {@link Config}.
 * <p>
 * Generated authorization signature is valid for a period of time and is
 * cached for effeciency.  The caching behavior may be customized with
 * properties {@link IAMConfig#durationSeconds} and
 * {@link IAMConfig#refreshAheadMs}. See their property descriptions for
 * details.
