/**
 * Authorization configuration for the driver provided as {@link Config#auth}

 * <p>
 * Every request to the server made by {@link NoSQLClient} methods requires
 * authorization information.  The way authorization information is obtained
 * depends on the {@link ServiceType} used (set as
 * {@link Config#serviceType}):
 * <ul>
 * <li>For {@link ServiceType.CLOUD}, authorization information is obtained
 * using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM). To
 * enable authorization, you must set {@link iam} property to IAM
 * configuration object in the form of {@link IAMConfig}. Alternatively, you
 * may set {@link provider} property to an instance of
 * {@link IAMAuthorizationProvider}. The only exception to this is if using
 * default default OCI configuration file and default profile name, in which
 * case you need not specify {@link Config#auth} property (see
 * {@link IAMConfig} and {@link ServiceType}).</li>
 * <li>For {@link ServiceType.CLOUDSIM}, authorization is not required and
 * you do not need to specify {@link Config#auth} property.</li>
 * <li>For {@link ServiceType.KVSTORE}, if using secure store, you need to
 * set {@link kvstore} property to specify the store authentication
 * information such as user name and password in the form of
 * {@link KVStoreAuthConfig}. Alternatively, you may set {@link provider}
 * property to an instance of {@link KVStoreAuthorizationProvider}.
 * <p>
 * If using non-secure store, authorization is not required and you do not
 * need to specify {@link Config#auth} property.</li>
 * <li>You may also choose to implement your own authorization provider to
 * obtain authorization information for each request. In this case, set
 * {@link provider} property to this provider's instance. If the provider is
 * set, {@link ServiceType} can be undefined, although it may also be possible
 * to have custom provider for existing service types.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that you must specify only one of {@link AuthConfig#iam},
 * {@link AuthConfig#kvstore} or {@link AuthConfig#provider} properties.
