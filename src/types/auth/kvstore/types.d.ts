/**
 * This configuration is required to authenticate against secure On-Premise
 * Oracle NoSQL Database.  It should be set as {@link AuthConfig#kvstore}.
 * To authenticate against secure kvstore the driver needs user name and
 * password of existing store user that has required permissions to perform
 * needed database operations (see {@page connect-on-prem.md} on how to set
 * up access to secure On-Premise Oracle NoSQL database).  The are 3 ways in
 * which these credentials may be specified.  In order of increased security,
 * they are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>You may set user name and password explicitly as
 * {@link user} and {@link password} (see
 * example). This is not very secure since password will be in memory in
 * plain text.  If password is specified as {@link !Buffer | Buffer}, it will
 * be copied when {@link NoSQLClient} is created and erased when
 * {@link NoSQLClient} is closed.</li>
 * <li>You may store user name and password in separate JSON file and set
 * the path to this file as {@link credentials} property.
 * This file should contain credentials in the form of
 * {@link KVStoreCredentials}.  It is more secure to store these credentials
 * in a separate file instead of main config file as access to this file may
 * be further restricted by appropriate permissions.  In addition, the
 * credentials will not be stored in memory but loaded from the file every
 * time when login is required.</li>
 * <li>You may implement and use your own {@link KVStoreCredentialsProvider}
 * to access credentials in secure way (e.g. by storing them in a keystore or
 * in encrypted form).  Set the provider instance as
 * {@link credentials} property.  The credentials should be returned in the
 * form of {@link KVStoreCredentials}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * See {@page connect-on-prem.md} tutorial on how to set up the driver to
 * access secure on-premise NoSQL store via proxy.  Note that secure
 * on-premise NoSQL store uses the same <em>endpoint</em> for authentication
 * and to perform database operations.  This endpoint must be using
 * <em>https</em> protocol.  See {@link Config#endpoint}.
 * <p>
 * If {@link autoRenew} property is set to true (which is
 * the default), after initial login is done, the driver will renew
 * authentication token each time it reaches half of its lifetime (half-point
 * between acquisition and expiration).  Renew request requires only existing
 * token and does not require user credentials.  If renew request fails, the
 * token will eventually expire and the driver will perform another login
 * (errors due to token expiration are automatically retried by the driver).
