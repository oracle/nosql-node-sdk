/**
 * NoSQL database allows you to store arbitrary precision decimal numbers
 * in tables by using database type <em>Number</em>, which supports all
 * numbers represented by Java BigDecimal class.  By default, the driver
 * represents them as Javascript numbers.  However this has some limitations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The number of significant digits is limited to what can be represented
 * by Javascript number type, which is approximately 15 decimal
 * digits, so the values with higher precision cannot be reresented exactly
 * and will be rounded.</li>
 * <li>The range is limited to what can be represented by Javascript numbers,
 * which is upproximately up to +-1e308.</li>
 * <li>Javascript numbers are stored in binary and not decimal format, which
 * means that some decimal values cannot be represented exactly and are
 * subject to rounding errors when performing decimal calculations.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Because Javascript and Node.js do not currently have a standard way to
 * represent arbitrary precision decimal numbers, the driver allows you to use
 * a 3rd party number library of your choice.  Typically the number libraries
 * represent numbers as objects of certain prototype or class and have methods
 * to perform arithmetic and other operations.  If you enable this feature,
 * the driver will represent the column values of datatype <em>Number</em> as
 * objects of this type from the number library.  You can pass these objects
 * as record fields for put operations, as key fields for get operations and
 * they will also be returned as part of get and query results wherever the
 * column value or expression result is of datatype <em>Number</em>.  Then
 * your application can use methods from the number library to perform further
 * numeric operations on number objects or convert them to suitable display
 * representation.
 * <p>
 * In most cases you only need the following:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Install the 3rd party number library of your choice (typically from
 * NPM) globally or as a dependency of your application (note that the driver
 * does not automatically install number libraries)</li>
 * <li>In the initial {@link Config} used to create {@link NoSQLClient},
 * specify <em>dbNumber</em> property as <em>dbNumber: 'module_name'</em>
 * where module_name is the module name of the number library</li>
 * </ol>
 * See examples below.
 * <p>
 * The above is sufficient for most cases when using default settings and
 * for number libraries that provide standard method names for common
 * operations.  The driver has been tested with the following number
 * libraries:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js | decimal.js}</li>
 * <li>{@link https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js-light | decimal.js-light}</li>
 * <li>{@link https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js | bignumber.js}</li>
 * <li>{@link https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js | big.js}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * These libraries should work out of the box with simple steps as described
 * above.  However you may use any number library of your choice as long as
 * it uses objects to represent arbitrary precision decimal numbers, provides
 * constructor function to create these objects and supports some common
 * operations.  Below we describe what the driver needs to know from the
 * number library and whether it will work out of the box as mentioned
 * above or if it may require additional configuration.
 * <p>
 * The driver needs to know the following:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Constructor function.  The constructor should be able to create
 * the number object from its string representation.  Typically the
 * number libraries export the constructor as a sole module export, so that
 * the result of <em>require('module_name')</em> is the
 * constructor.  In this case no additional configuration is required.
 * </li>
 * <li> Conversion to string.  Typically this is the instance method
 * <em>toString</em> (overriden from <em>Object</em> class), in which case no
 * additional configuration is required.</li>
 * <li> Operations for comparison, addition, subtraction, multiplication and
 * division, as may be needed by the driver for client-side query processing.
 * These are typically static (properties of the constructor itself)
 * and/or instance methods (properties of constructor's prototype), with the
 * static methods taking 2 arguments and instance
 * methods taking one argument.  The driver will look for common method names
 * (instance or static) such as "add", "plus" for addition, "subtract", "sub",
 * "minus" for subtraction, etc.  See {@link NumberLibMethods} for complete
 * list of names.  If the number library of your choice uses any of the common
 * names for each operation listed above, no additional configuration is
 * required.</li>
 * <li> Precision and rounding mode.  These are optional and if not specified,
 * default values will be used.  On the server side, NoSQL database uses Java
 * BigDecimal to do calculations for Number datatype during query processing.
 * The result of each operation is rounded accoring to Java MathContext
 * settings, which consist of precision (number of significant digits) and
 * rounding mode (how to round the result to precision), so these settings
 * need to be provided to the server for query processing.  You may choose to
 * provide them explicitly in configuration (see {@link NumberLibConfig}) or
 * let the driver figure them out from the number library settings using some
 * common property names (see {@link NumberLibPrecision} and
 * {@link NumberLibRoundingMode}).  If not found, default precision of 20 and
 * rounding mode <em>ROUND_HALF_UP</em> will be used.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Note that configuration for this feature is always specified as
 * <em>dbNumber</em> property of {@link Config} and thus can be provided
 * either as part of {@link Config} Javascript object or in JSON file
 * containing {@link Config}.
 * <p>
 * <em>dbNumber</em> property can be one of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>String specifying number library module name as discussed above.</li>
 * <li>Constructor function (not available if using JSON file).  You may
 * specify constructor function explicitly.  This is useful when you want to
 * set custom settings for the constructor (to customize created number
 * instances) before passing it to the driver instead of using default number
 * library settings.  Also see {@link NumberLibConfig#Constructor}.</li>
 * <li>{@link NumberLibConfig} object if more complex configuration is
 * desired.
 * </li>
 * </ul>

/**
 * This object can be set as {@link Config#dbNumber} property
 * to specify configuration for using 3rd party number libary when additional
 * information is required, as described in {@link DBNumberConfig}.
 * <p>
 * The only required property is {@link Constructor}. As menitoned,
 * <em>static</em> and <em>instance</em> properties are only needed when
 * the number library is not using common method names, or if you need to
 * customize implementation, see {@link NumberLibMethods}.
 * <p>
 * An important note about precision and rounding:
 * <p>
 * Different number libraries have different options to round the results
 * of arithmetic and other operations.  For example, some libraries like
 * <em>decimal.js</em> and <em>decimal.js-light</em> round to precision, which
 * is total number of significant digits in the number.  These libraries
 * typically have a precision value specified as configuration setting in the
 * constructor.  Other libraries, like <em>bignumber.js</em> and
 * <em>big.js</em> round to scale, or decimal places, which is number of
 * digits after decimal point.  These libraries typically have decimal
 * places value as configuration setting in the constructor.  In addition,
 * some libraries, like <em>decimal.js</em> and <em>bignumber.js</em> do
 * automatic rounding of some arithmetic operations and other libraries like
 * <em>big.js</em> and <em>decimal.js-light</em> allow only manual rounding
 * via methods such as <em>round</em>.
 * <p>
 * The above may have implication on some query results.  On the server side,
 * NoSQL database uses Java BigDecimal and rounds each arithmetic operation
 * according to precision and rounding mode settings of MathContext, as
 * mentioned in {@link DBNumberConfig}.  The driver, on the other hand, does
 * not perform rounding during query processing, other than the rounding
 * performed automatically by some number libraries as mentioned above.  This
 * means that for queries that use arithmetic expressions and some aggregate
 * functions, the query results may slightly differ when using different
 * number libraries.  From the libraries tested, <em>decimal.js</em> has the
 * closest matching behavior to query processing on the server side because
 * it automatically rounds arithmetic operations to precision using rounding
 * mode setting.
 * <p>
 * You may also use the rounding methods from the number library to perform
 * rounding after receiving query results.  This may be useful when using
 * number libraries that do not perform automatic rounding.  In addition,
 * number libraries may have other settings related to rounding.  See
 * documentation for the number library of your choice.  If required, you can
 * clone and customize the constructor and pass it as
 * {@link Constructor} property.  You may also customize
 * arithmetic operations further using <em>static</em> and <em>instance</em>
 * properties, see {@link NumberLibMethods}, in case non-standard behavior is
 * needed.
 * <p>
 * The driver need to know precision and rounding mode in order to create
 * MathContext for server-side query processing.  It will try to infer these
 * settings from the constructor as described in {@link NumberLibPrecision}
 * and {@link NumberLibRoundingMode}.  For libraries that round to scale,
 * such as <em>bignumber.js</em> and <em>big.js</em>, it is not possible
 * to infer precision from constructor, so you may need to set
 * {@link precision} property, otherwise the driver will use the default
 * value.  For {@link precision} and {@link roundingMode} properties, if
 * set, the driver will use their values instead of inferring them from
 * the constructor.
 * <p>
 * Note that setting properties {@link precision} and {@link roundingMode}
 * only affects how rounding is done on the server side.  The driver will not
 * set any properties of the constructor.  If the number library does
 * automatic rounding, it will do so based on the constructor as passed.  If
 * the number library supports precision and rounding mode settings and does
 * automatic rounding/trucation, you can ensure that the same settings are
 * used by the server and the client by letting the driver infer them from
 * the constructor (by using {@link getPrecision} and
 * {@link getRoundingMode} properties if necessary).  E.g. for libraries
 * <em>decimal.js</em> and <em>decimal.js-light</em> the driver will
 * automatically infer and use precision and rounding mode settings.
