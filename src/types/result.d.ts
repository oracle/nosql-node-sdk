 * to 1 KB in size. A read that is absolutely consistent is double that,
 * consuming 2 read units for a read of up to 1 KB in size. This means that if
 * an application is to use {@link Consistency.ABSOLUTE} it may need to
 * specify additional read units when creating a table. A write unit
 * represents 1 write per second of data up to 1 KB in size.  Note that:
 * <ul>
 * <li>For read operations, such as {@link NoSQLClient#get},
 * {@link NoSQLClient#prepare} and {@link NoSQLClient#query}, the number of
 * units consumed {@link readUnits} maybe larger than the
 * number of read KBytes {@link readKB} if the operation used
 * absolute consistency.  See {@link Consistency.ABSOLUTE }.</li>
 * <li>For update operations, such as {@link NoSQLClient#put},
 * {@link NoSQLClient#delete}, {@link NoSQLClient#deleteRange},
 * {@link NoSQLClient#writeMany} and others, the number of read units consumed
 * {@link ConsumedCapacity#readUnits} may also be larger than the number of
 * read KBytes {@link readKB}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When driver-side rate limiting is enabled (see {@link Config#rateLimiter}),
 * two additional properties, {@link readRateLimitDelay} and
 * {@link writeRateLimitDelay} may be set.  They specify how long given
 * operation was delayed by the rate limiter due to reads and writes
 * performed, respectively (note that each of these values is set only if
 * given operation does reads and/or writes, correspondingly).  These values
 * may be useful in gathering statistics to analyze performance and adjust
 * rate limiter configuration (when using custom rate limiter).
 * See {@link RateLimiter}.  Note that total time the operation was delayed
 * due to rate limiting is {@link readRateLimitDelay} (if set) +
