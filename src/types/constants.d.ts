/**
 * Service type is specified in the initial configuration used to create
 * {@link NoSQLClient} instance and indicates what kind of service the
 * driver will be using.  Currently supported values are
 * {@link ServiceType.CLOUDSIM}, {@link ServiceType.CLOUD} and
 * {@link ServiceType.KVSTORE}.  In addition to {@link ServiceType}
 * enumeration, these values may be specified as strings "CLOUDSIM", "CLOUD"
 * or "KVSTORE", case-insensitive.  This is useful if using JSON configuration
 * file.  If {@link ServiceType} is not present in the initial configuration,
 * the driver will try to deduce service type from the
 * information provided in authorization property {@link Config#auth} (see
 * {@link AuthConfig}) in the following way:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If {@link Config#auth} is undefined or null, the service type is
 * determined as follows: if {@link Config#region} is specified, the service
 * type defaults to {@link ServiceType.CLOUD}, otherwise it defaults to
 * {@link ServiceType.CLOUDSIM}.
 * <li>If {@link Config#auth} contains {@link AuthConfig#iam} property, the
 * service type is assumed to be {@link ServiceType.CLOUD}.</li>
 * <li>If {@link Config#auth} constains {@link AuthConfig#kvstore} property,
 * the service type is assumed to be {@link ServiceType.KVSTORE}.  Note that
 * unless {@link Config#serviceType} is explicitly specified, you may not
 * specify both {@link AuthConfig#iam} and {@link AuthConfig#kvstore}
 * properties at the same time.  You may specify value <em>\{\}</em> (empty
 * object) for {@link AuthConfig#kvstore} property to connect to non-secure
 * kvstore, although it is advisable to specify the service type explicitly in
 * this case. See {@link ServiceType.KVSTORE}.</li>
 * <li>If {@link Config#auth} does not contain either of the above properties,
 * the driver will check if it contains user-specified
 * {@link AuthorizationProvider} (see {@link AuthConfig#provider}).  In this
 * case the service type will remain undefined and user-specified provider
 * will be used to control access to the service.  If there is no
 * user-specified {@link AuthorizationProvider} in {@link Config#auth}, this
 * is equivalent to {@link Config#auth} not defined and the service type will
 * default to {@link ServiceType.CLOUD} or {@link ServiceType.CLOUDSIM} as
 * described above.</li>
 * </ul>
