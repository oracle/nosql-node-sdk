/**
 * This is the base class for all errors returned by the driver.
 * {@link NoSQLError} extends JavaScript Error class and all other errors used
 * by the driver extend {@link NoSQLError}.  Note that you don't create these
 * error objects explicitly, but the driver returns errors in the following
 * ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>For synchronous APIs the error is thrown as an exception</li>
 * <li>For asynchronous APIs, which is most of the APIs in {@link NoSQLClient}
 * class, the error is the result of the rejection of Promise returned by
 * the API.  In async function, you can use <em>try...catch</em> to handle
 * these errors as if they were exceptions.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Each error contains {@link ErrorCode} which can be used in the application
 * logic to take different actions upon different kinds of errors.  In
 * addition, an error may have an optional {@link cause}, which is another
 * error that caused this error.  The {@link cause} is typically also
 * instance of {@link NoSQLError} or its subclass, but sometimes may not be.
 * E.g. if an authorization error is caused by invalid JSON response, the
 * {@link cause} would be instance of {@link !SyntaxError | SyntaxError}.
 * <p>
 * In addition, each error has an optional operation object which describes
 * the operation that caused the error, including the API and its arguments,
 * see {@link Operation}. Not all errors have operation available.
 * <p>
 * Most errors returned from the server result in {@link NoSQLError}, but for
 * other cases specialized subclasses are used such as
 * {@link NoSQLArgumentError}, {@link NoSQLServiceError},
 * {@link NoSQLNetworkError}, {@link NoSQLAuthorizationError} and others.

 * <li>{@link ErrorCode.REQUEST_TIMEOUT} indicates that timeout was exceeded

 * invalid user credentials (user name and password).  See error message for
 * more information</li>
 * <li>{@link ErrorCode.UNAUTHORIZED} may indicate insufficient permissions
 * while trying to obtain authorization information.
 * <li>{@link ErrorCode.CREDENTIALS_ERROR} indicates error accessing user or
 * application credentials.  The reason for this error depends on what
 * credential provider is used for the authorization.</li>
 * <li>{@link ErrorCode.NETWORK_ERROR} indicates error communicating with the

 * <li>{@link ErrorCode.BAD_PROTOCOL_MESSAGE} indicates invalid protocol
 * message received by the client such as invalid part of a query plan or
 * invalid or inconsistent data for partition sorting.</li>
 * <li>{@link ErrorCode.ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT} indicates invalid or missing query
 * parameters or operands, such as missing value for bound variable,
 * non-numeric operand for arithmetic expression, non-numeric parameter for
 * OFFSET or LIMIT clause, etc.</li>
 * <li>{@link ErrorCode.ILLEGAL_STATE} indicates illegal state in the query
