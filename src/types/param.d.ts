 * TTL is restricted to durations of days and hours, with day being

 * you can specify TTL as just a number indicating number of days, so using
 * e.g. <em>opt.ttl = 5;</em> is also allowed.

 * by setting days or hours of to Infinity (or just set TTL itself to
 * Infinity), or use constant {@link TTLUtil.DO_NOT_EXPIRE}.
 * <p>
 * The record expiration time is determined as follows:
 * <p>
 * Records expire on day or hour boundaries, depending on which 'days' or
 * 'hours' field is used.  At the time of the write operation, the TTL
 * parameter is used to compute the record's expiration time by first
 * converting it from days (or hours) to milliseconds, and then adding it
 * to the current system time. If the resulting expiration time is not evenly
 * divisible by the number of milliseconds in one day (or hour), it is
 * rounded up to the nearest day (or hour). The day and hour boundaries (the
 * day boundary is at midnight) are considered in UTC time zone.
 * <p>
 * The minimum TTL that can be specified is 1 hour. Because of the rounding
 * behavior described above, the actual record duration will be longer than
 * specified in the TTL (because of rounding up).
 * <p>
 * Also note that using duration of days are recommended as it will result in
 * the least amount of storage overhead compared to duration of hours.
