/**
 * {@link IAMConfig} is required to authorize operations using Oracle Cloud
 * Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM).  It should be set as
 * {@link AuthConfig}#iam.
 * <p>
 * See [Overview of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management]{@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm}
 * for information on IAM components and how they work together to provide
 * security for Oracle Cloud services.
 * <p>
 * All operations require a request signature that is used by the system to
 * authorize the operation.  The request signature may be created in one of
 * the following ways:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Using specific user's indentity.  See information below on what
 * credentials are required and how to obtain them, as well as the ways these
 * credentials may be provided to the driver via {@link IAMConfig}.</li>
 * <li>Using Instance Principal.  You may use Instance Principal when
 * calling Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service from a compute instance in the
 * Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). See
 * [Calling Services from an Instance]{@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm}
 * for more information.  Use Instance Principal by setting
 * {@link IAMConfig}#useInstancePrincipal property to true.</li>
 * <li>Using Resource Principal.  You may use Resource Principal when calling
 * Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service from other Oracle Cloud service
 * resource such as
 * [Functions]{@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Concepts/functionsoverview.htm}.
 * See
 * [Accessing Other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Resources from Running Functions]{@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Tasks/functionsaccessingociresources.htm}
 * for more information.  Use Resouce Principal by setting
 * {@link IAMConfig}#useResourcePrincipal property to true.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Note that when using Instance Principal or Resource Principal you must
 * specify compartiment id (OCID), either as
 * {@link Config}#compartment property of the initial configuration or as
 * <em>opt.compartment</em> for each {@link NoSQLClient} method call.  Note
 * that you must use compartment id (OCID) and not compartment name.  This
 * also means that you may not prefix table name with compartment name when
 * calling methods of {@link NoSQLClient}.  These restrictions do not apply
 * when using specific user identity, which is best when naming flexibility is
 * desired.
 * <p>
 * To use specific user's identity, you must provide the following credentials:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Tenancy OCID.  This is Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) for your tenancy.  See
 * [Resource Identifiers]{@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm}
 * for information on OCIDs.</li>
 * <li>User's OCID.  This is Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) for the user in your
 * tenancy.  See [Resource Identifiers]{@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm}
 * for information on OCIDs.</li>
 * <li>API Signing Key.  This is public-private key pair used to sign the API
 * requests, see [Required Keys and OCIDs]{@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm}.
 * In particular, private key is needed to generate the request signature.</li>
 * <li>Public Key Fingerprint.  This is an identifier of the public key of the
 * API Signing Key pair.</li>
 * <li>Passphrase for the private key of API Signing Key pair if the private
 * key is encrypted.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * See [Required Keys and OCIDs]{@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm}
 * for detailed description of the above credentials and the steps you need to
 * perform to enable signing of API requests, which are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Generate the key pair described above.</li>
 * <li>Upload public key.</li>
 * <li>Obtain tenancy and user OCIDs and public key fingerprint.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * You may provide these credentials in one of the following ways, in order of
 * increased security:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Directly as properties of {@link IAMConfig}.
 * In this case, set properties <em>tenantId</em>, <em>userId</em>,
 * <em>privateKey</em> or <em>privateKeyFile</em>, <em>fingerprint</em> and
 * <em>passphrase</em> (if private key is encrypted)</li>
 * <li>As part of an OCI configuration file.  See
 * [SDK and CLI Configuration File]{@link https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm}
 * for information on OCI configuration file and what entries are used for the
 * required credentials.  In this case, you may set properties
 * <em>configFile</em> and/or <em>profileName</em>.  If not set,
 * appropriate default values will be used, see property descriptions.</li>
 * <li>Specify your own credentials provider in the form of
 * {@link IAMCredentialsProvider} that implements {@link loadIAMCredentials}
 * function.  This allows you to store and retrieve credentials in a secure
 * manner.  In this case, specify <em>credentialsProvider</em> property.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Note that the private key must be in PEM format.  You may provide a path
 * to the PEM key file.  Alternatively, except when using OCI configuration
 * file, you may provide PEM encoded private key directly as <em>Buffer</em>
 * or <em>string</em>.  Note that the <em>passphrase</em> must be provided if
 * the private key is encrypted.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The driver will determine the method of authorization as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>If {@link IAMConfig}#useResourcePrincipal is set to <em>true</em>, then
 * Resource Principal authorization will be used.  No other properties listed
 * below are allowed for Resource Prinicpal authorization.</li>
 * <li>If {@link IAMConfig}#useInstancePrincipal is set to <em>true</em>, then
 * Instance Principal authorization will be used.  You may also set
 * {@link IAMConfig}#federationEndpoint, although it is not requred and in
 * most cases federation endpoint will be auto-detected.  No other properties
 * listed below are allowed for Instance Principal authorization.</li>
 * <li>If {@link IAMConfig} has any of user identity properties such as
 * <em>tenantId</em>, <em>userId</em>, <em>fingerprint</em>,
 * <em>privateKeyFile</em>, <em>privateKey</em> or <em>passphrase</em>,
 * the driver assumes that you are using a specific user's identity
 * and that the credentials are provided directly in {@link IAMConfig}.  All
 * required user's credentials, as described above, must be present as
 * properties of {@link IAMConfig}, otherwise {@link NoSQLArgumentError} will
 * result.</li>
 * <li>If {@link IAMConfig} has <em>credentialsProvider</em> property, the
 * driver assumes that you are using a specific user's identity and the
 * credentials are obtained through the credentials provider which must be in
 * the form of {@link IAMCredentialsProvider}.  In this case the credentials
 * must not be set directly in {@link IAMConfig}.</li>
 * <li>If none of the above, the driver assumes that you are using a specific
 * user's identity and the credentials are stored in OCI config
 * file and will use <em>configFile</em> and <em>profileName</em> properties
 * if present, otherwise it will assume their default values.  In particular,
 * if you specify {@link Config}#serviceType as {@link ServiceType.CLOUD}
 * and omit {@link Config}#auth alltogether, the driver will use IAM
 * authorization with default OCI config file and default profile name.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Note that if using an OCI configuration file, you may also specify region
 * identifier in the same profile as your credentials.  In this case, you need
 * not specify either region or endpoint in {@link Config}.  In particular,
 * if you use the default OCI config file (<em>~/.oci/config</em>) and default
 * profile name (<em>DEFAULT</em>) and do not need to customize any other
 * configuration properties, you may create {@link NoSQLClient} instance
 * without providing configuration to {@link NoSQLClient} constructor.
 * See {@link NoSQLClient} for more information.
 * <p>
 * If using Resource Principal, you also need not specify either region or
 * endpoint in {@link Config}, as Resource Principal's region will be used.
 * In fact, when running in Functions service, you may only access NoSQL
 * service in the same region as the running function, so when using Resource
 * Principal, it is preferable not to specify either region or endpoint in
 * {@link Config}.
 * <p>
 * Generated authorization signature is valid for a period of time and is
 * cached for effeciency.  The caching behavior may be customized with
 * properties {@link IAMConfig}#durationSeconds and
 * {@link IAMConfig}#refreshAheadMs. See their property descriptions for
 * details.

 * @property {string} [fingerprint] Public key fingerprint
 * @property {Buffer|string} [passphrase] Passphrase for the private key if it
 * is encrypted.  If specified as <em>Buffer</em>, you may clear the buffer
 * contents after {@link NoSQLClient} instance is created for added security
 * @property {string|Buffer} [configFile='~/.oci/config'] OCI configuration
 * file path.  May be absolute or relative to current directory.  May be
 * <em>string</em> or UTF-8 encoded <em>Buffer</em>.  If not
 * set, the default is used which is "~/.oci/config", where "~" represents
 * user's home directory on Unix systems and %USERPROFILE% directory on
 * Windows (see USERPROFILE environment variable)
 * @property {string} [profileName='DEFAULT'] Profile name within the OCI
 * configuration file, used only if credentials are obtained from the
 * configuration file as described.  If not set, the name "DEFAULT" is used
 * @property {IAMCredentialsProvider|string} [credentialsProvider] Custom
 * credentials provider to use to obtain credentials in the form of

 * which is also the default
 * @property {number} [refreshAheadMs=10000] Tells the driver when to
 * automatically refresh the signature before its expiration in the cache,
 * measured in number of milliseconds before expiration.  E.g. value 10000
 * means that the driver will attempt to refresh the signature 10 seconds
 * before its expiration.  Using refresh allows to avoid slowing down of
 * database operations by creating the signature asynchronously.  You can set
 * this property to null to disable automatic refresh
 * @property {number} [timeout=120000] Timeout in milliseconds used for
 * requests to the authorization server.  Currently this is only used with
 * Instance Principal
 * @property {string|DelegationTokenProvider} [delegationToken] Used only with
 * instance principal (see <em>useInstancePrincipal</em>).
 * The delegation token allows the instance to assume the privileges of the
 * user for which the token was created and act on behalf of that user.  Use
 * this property to specify the value of the delegation token directly.
 * Otherwise, to use a provider interface or obtain a token from a file, use
 * <em>delegationTokenProvider</em> property. This property is exclusive with
 * <em>delegationTokenProvider</em>.
 * @property {string|DelegationTokenProvider} [delegationTokenProvider] Used
 * only with instance principal (see <em>useInstancePrincipal</em>).
 * The delegation token allows the instance to assume the privileges of the
 * user for which the token was created and act on behalf of that user.  Use
 * this property to specify how delegation token is to be obtained.  If
 * set as a string, it will be interpreted as file path (absolute or relative)
 * to load the delegation token from.  Otherwise, specify
 * {@link DelegationTokenProvider} as a custom provider used to load the
 * delegation token.  In either case, the delegation token will be reloaded
 * each time the authorization signature is refreshed.  This property is
 * exclusive with <em>delegationToken</em>.
