/**
 * @classdesc
 * Cloud Service or Cloud Simulator only.
 * <p>
 * Default implementation of rate limiter class used by the driver.
 * Two rate limiter instances are used per each table in use, one for reads
 * and another for writes.  See {@link RateLimiter}.
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses a token bucket based algorithm, although
 * the state is kept in terms of nano time instead of tokens.  It is assumed
 * that the units refill at constant rate being equivalent to the set limit
 * of units per second.  The state is kept in terms of <em>nextNano</em> which
 * is the time when the next operation can proceed without waiting, meaning
 * the limiter is at its limit.  All operations issued before
 * <em>nextNano</em> will have to wait accordingly.  Based on the value of
 * <em>nextNano</em> and the current time, the appropriate wait time may be
 * computed before the wait begins.  If current time is >= <em>nextNano</em>,
 * no wait is needed.
 * <p>
 * Note that when {@link SimpleRateLimiter#consumeUnits} is called, the
 * entered units will only affect the wait time of subsequent operations and
 * not the current operation, which will use the value of <em>nextNano</em> as
 * it was to determine its wait time.  This should avoid needless wait time
 * when the operations come in rarely.
 * <p> Because every time when {@link SimpleRateLimiter#consumeUnits} is
 * called with units > 0, <em>nextNano</em> is pushed forward, the operations
 * will be effectively staggered in time accoridng to the order of their
 * arrival with no preferrential treatment given to any operation, thus
 * avoiding starvation.
 * <p>
 * This limiter uses burst mode, allowing a set maximum number of stored units
 * that has not been used to be consumed immediately without waiting. This
 * value is expressed as <em>maxBurstSecs</em> or duration, which is
 * effectively a maximum number of seconds worth of unused stored units.
 * The minimum duration is internally bound such that at least one unused unit
 * may be consumed without waiting.  The default value of duration is
 * 30 seconds.
 * 
 * @see {@link RateLimiter}
 * @see {@link Config}
