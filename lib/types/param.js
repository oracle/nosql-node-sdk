/**
 * Defines types used as parameters and options for operations of NoSQL
 * driver.
 */

/**
 * Note: this type is only relevant when using the driver with the Cloud
 * Service or Cloud Simulator.  It is not relevant when using the driver
 * with on-premise NoSQL Database (see {@link ServiceType.KVSTORE}), in which
 * case it is ignored in the operations mentioned below and is not returned as
 * part of {@link TableResult}.
 * <p>
 * A TableLimits object is used during table creation to specify the
 * throughput and capacity to be consumed by the table. It is also used
 * in an operation to change the limits of an existing table.  These
 * operations are performed by {@link NoSQLClient#tableDDL} and
 * {@link NoSQLClient#setTableLimits} methods.  The values provided are
 * enforced by the system and used for billing purposes.
 * <p>
 * Throughput limits are defined in terms of read units and write units.  A
 * read unit represents 1 eventually consistent read per second for data up to
 * 1 KB in size. A read that is absolutely consistent is double that,
 * consuming 2 read units for a read of up to 1 KB in size. This means that if
 * an application is to use {@link Consistency.ABSOLUTE} it may need to
 * specify additional read units when creating a table. A write unit
 * represents 1 write per second of data up to 1 KB in size.
 * <p>
 * In addition to throughput, table capacity must be specified to indicate
 * the maximum amount of storage, in gigabytes, allowed for the table.
 * <p>
 * In PROVISIONED mode (the default), all 3 values must be specified whenever
 * using this object. There are no defaults and no mechanism to indicate
 * "no change."
 * <p>
 * In ON_DEMAND mode, only the storageGB parameter must be specified.
 *
 * @example //Specifying table limits when creating a provisioned table
 * client.tableDDL(
 *     'CREATE TABLE table1(id INTEGER, name STRING, PRIMARY KEY(id))',
 *     {
 *         tableLimits: {
 *             readUnits: 1000,
 *             writeUnits: 500,
 *             storageGB: 100
 *         }
 *     }
 * );
 *
 * @example //Specifying table limits when creating an on demand table
 * client.tableDDL(
 *     'CREATE TABLE table1(id INTEGER, name STRING, PRIMARY KEY(id))',
 *     {
 *         tableLimits: {
 *             storageGB: 100,
 *             mode: CapacityMode.ON_DEMAND
 *         }
 *     }
 * );
 *
 * @global
 * @typedef {object} TableLimits
 * @property {number} readUnits The desired throughput of read operation in
 * terms of read units, as a positive integer.  A read unit represents 1
 * eventually consistent read per second for data up to 1 KB in size. A read
 * that is absolutely consistent is double that, consuming 2 read units for
 * a read of up to 1 KB in size. See {@link Consistency}
 * @property {number} writeUnits The desired throughput of write operation in
 * terms of write units, as a positive integer. A write unit represents 1
 * write per second of data up to 1 KB in size
 * @property {number} storageGB The maximum storage to be consumed by the
 * table, in gigabytes, as positive integer
 * @property {CapacityMode} mode The mode of the table: CapacityMode.PROVISIONED
 * (the default) or CapacityMode.ON_DEMAND.

/**
 * Version is an opaque type that represents the version of a row in the

 * {@link NoSQLClient#putIfVersion}, {@link NoSQLClient#delete} and
 * {@link NoSQLClient#deleteIfVersion} methods to conditionally perform those
 * operations to ensure an atomic read-modify-write cycle. This is an opaque
 * object from an application perspective.  Use of <em>Version</em> in this
 * way adds cost to operations so it should be done only if necessary
 * @global
 * @typedef {Buffer} Version
 */

/**
 * ContinuationKey is an opaque type that represents continuation key for
 * certain operations such as {@link NoSQLClient#deleteRange} and
 * {@link NoSQLClient#query}.  It is used to perform an operation across
 * multiple calls to these methods (such as in a loop until continuation
 * key becomes null).  This is an opaque type from application perspective
 * and only values from previous results should be used.

/**
 * Used to specify time to live (TTL) for rows provided to
 * {@link NoSQLClient#put} and other put methods, such as
 * {@link NoSQLClient#putIfAbsent}, {@link NoSQLClient#putIfPresent} and
 * {@link NoSQLClient#putIfVersion}.
 * TTL is restricted to durations of days and hours, with day being
 * 24 hours.  Note that you may only specify only one of
 * {@link TimeToLive}#days or {@link TimeToLive}#hours fields, not both.
 * You may specify TTL as object such as <em>{ days: numDays }</em> or
 * <em>{ hours: numHours }</em>, or if you are using duration of days
 * you can specify TTL as just a number indicating number of days, so using
 * e.g. <em>opt.ttl = 5;</em> is also allowed.
 * <p>
 * Sometimes you may may need to indicate explicitly that the record doesn't
 * expire.  This is needed when you perform put operation on existing record
 * and want to remove its expiration.  You may indicate no expiration
 * by setting days or hours of to Infinity (or just set TTL itself to
 * Infinity), or use constant {@link TTLUtil.DO_NOT_EXPIRE}.
 * <p>
 * The record expiration time is determined as follows:
 * <p>
 * Records expire on day or hour boundaries, depending on which 'days' or
 * 'hours' field is used.  At the time of the write operation, the TTL
 * parameter is used to compute the record's expiration time by first
 * converting it from days (or hours) to milliseconds, and then adding it
 * to the current system time. If the resulting expiration time is not evenly
 * divisible by the number of milliseconds in one day (or hour), it is
 * rounded up to the nearest day (or hour).  The day and hour
 * boundaries (the day boundary is at midnight) are considered in UTC time
 * zone.
 * <p>
 * The minimum TTL that can be specified is 1 hour.  Because of the rounding
 * behavior described above, the actual record duration will be longer than
 * specified in the TTL (because of rounding up).
 * <p>
 * Also note that using duration of days are recommended as it will result in
 * the least amount of storage overhead compared to duration of hours.
 * <p>
 * {@link TTLUtil} class provides functions to create and manage TTL
 * instances and convert between TTL and record expiration time.
 *
 * @see {@link TTLUtil}

 * @typedef {object} TimeToLive
 * @property {number} [days] Duration in days as positive integer or Infinity.

/**
 * FieldRange defines a range of values to be used in a
 * {@link NoSQLClient#deleteRange} operation, as specified in
 * <em>opt.fieldRange</em> for that operation.
 * <p>
 * FieldRange is used as the least significant component in a partially
 * specified key value in order to create a value range for an operation that
 * returns multiple rows or keys. The data types supported by FieldRange are
 * limited to the atomic types which are valid for primary keys.
 * <p>
 * The <i>least significant component</i> of a key is the first component of
 * the key that is not fully specified. For example, if the primary key for a
 * table is defined as the tuple &lt;a, b, c&gt; a FieldRange can be specified
 * for <em>a</em> if the primary key supplied is empty. A FieldRange can be
 * specified for <em>b</em> if the primary key supplied to the operation
 * has a concrete value for <em>a</em> but not for <em>b</em> or <em>c</em>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This object is used to scope a {@link NoSQLClient#deleteRange} operation.
 * The fieldName specified must name a field in a table's primary key.
 * The values used must be of the same type and that type must match
 * the type of the field specified.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You may specify the {@link FieldValue} for lower bound, upper bound or
 * both.  Each bound may be either inclusive, meaning the range starts with
 * (for lower bound) or ends with (for upper bound) with this value, or
 * exclusive, meaning the range starts after (for lower bound) or ends before
 * (for upper bound) the value.  Properties <em>startWith</em> and
 * <em>endWith</em> specify inclusive bounds and properties
 * <em>startAfter</em> and <em>endBefore</em> specify exclusive bounds.  Note
 * that for each end of the range you may specify either inclusive or
 * exclusive bound, but not both.
 * <p>
 * Validation of this object is performed when it is used in an operation.
 * Validation includes verifying that the field is in the required key and,
 * in the case of a composite key, that the field is in the proper order
 * relative to the key used in the operation.
 *
 * @example //Using NoSQLClient#deleteRange with FieldRange
 *  let res = await this._client.deleteRange('Emp', //table name
 *      {
 *          region: 'US'             //partial primary key

 *              endBefore: 1054
